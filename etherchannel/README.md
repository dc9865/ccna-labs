# EtherChannel Configuration Lab (L2 & L3)

## 📌 Overview
This lab demonstrates the configuration of Layer 2 and Layer 3 EtherChannels using multiple negotiation methods (LACP, PAgP, and Static) across access and distribution switches. Trunking, routing, and load-balancing behaviors are also validated.

---

## 🧠 Lab Objectives
1. Configure Layer 2 EtherChannel (LACP) between ASW1 and DSW1 and set as trunk  
2. Configure Layer 2 EtherChannel (PAgP) between ASW2 and DSW2 and set as trunk  
3. Configure Layer 3 EtherChannel (Static) between DSW1 and DSW2  
4. Configure routing so PCs can reach SRV1  
5. Identify default EtherChannel load-balancing method  
6. Change load-balancing to source & destination IP

## 🗺️ Topology Summary
- Access Switches: ASW1, ASW2  
- Distribution Switches: DSW1, DSW2  
- End hosts IP addresses are pre-configured  
- Multiple physical links exist between switch pairs
