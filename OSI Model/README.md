## Overview
This lab examines network traffic using Simulation Mode in Cisco Packet Tracer. Traffic flows are analyzed to determine which layers of the OSI model are used during common network operations. Layer 7 traffic is generated by releasing and renewing an IP address on an end device.

## Objectives
- Use simulation mode to observe network traffic.
- Identify OSI layers involved in packet exchange.
- Generate Layer 7 traffic from an end device.
- Anaylze packet details in simulation mode

## Topology
- PC1 -> SW2 -> SW1 -> R1 -> R2
- Server 1 -> SW1

## Networks:
- 192.168.1.0/24 (LAN)
- 10.0.0.0/24 (Inter-router link)

## Commands:
- ipconfig /release
- ipconfig /renew

## Observations
- ARP operates at Layer2 
- ICMP operates at Layer 3 
- DHCP operates at Layer 7 
- Switches forward frames using MAC addresses
- Routers forward packets using IP addresses

## Verification
- Simulation Mode packet inspection
- Packet details window (OSI Model tab)

## Conclusion
- This lab demonstrates how different OSI layers participate in everyday network communication. Using simulation mode makes it possible to visually track packets and understand how Layer 2 through Layer 7 processes work together in a functiong network.
