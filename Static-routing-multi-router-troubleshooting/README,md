# Lab 11 (Part 2) - Static Routing Troubleshooting Between Multiple Routers

## Overview
This lab focuses on troubleshooting static routing issues in a multi-router environment. The network topology consists of three routers connecting two separate LANs. Each router contains one misconfiguration that prevents end-to-end connectivity. By identifying and correcting these issues, static routing is restored and successful communication between PC1 and PC2 is achieved.

## Objectives
- Understand static routing behavior across multiple routers
- Identify and fix common router misconfigurations
- Verify IP addressing and interface configurations
- Validate static routes and routing tables
- Confirm end-to-end connectivity using ping

## Toplogy Summary
- 3 Cisco 2911 routers (R1,R2,R3)
- 2 Cisco 2960-24TT switches (SW1 and SW2)
- 2 PCs (PC1 and PC2) located in different networks
- Multiple routed networks interconnected using Gigabit Ethernet links

## Network Segments
- 192.168.1.0/24 - PC1 LAN
- 192.168.12.0/24 - R1 <-> R2 link
- 192.168.13.0/24 - R2 <-> R3 link
- 192.168.3.0/24 - PC2 LAN

## Initial Conditions
- All devices were powered on
- IP addressing was partially configured
- One misconfiguration existed on each router
- Static routes were incorrect or incomplete
- PC1 and PC2 were unable to ping each other

## Traffic Flow (PC1 Ping PC2)
1. PC1 sends an ICMP Echo Request to PC2.
2. PC1 forwardsd the packet to its default gateway (R1).
3. R1 forwards the packet to R2 using a corrected static route.
4. R2 forwards the packet to R3 after fixing its routing/interface issue.
5. R3 forwards the packet to PC2's local network.
6. PC2 responds with an ICMP Echo Reply, which travels back through R3 -> R2 -> R1 to PC1.

## Observations
- A single incorrect static route can break end-to-end connectivity
- Routers only forward traffic to known networks in their routing table
- Interface misconfigurations can prevent routes from functioning correctly
- Connectivity is restored only when all routing and interface issues are resolved

## Verification
1. Routers:
  - show ip route
  - show ip interface brief
2. PCs:
  - ipconfig
  - ping [destination-ip]

## Procedure Summary
- Reviewed IP addressing and interface status on all routers.
- Identified and corrected one misconfiguration on each router.
- Verified interface configurations and ensured all required interfaces were up
- Fixed static routes to properly reach remote networks
- Confirmed routing table accuracy using show commands
- Successfully verified end-to-end connectivity between PC1 and PC2 using ping
